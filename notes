The name of the pub should be "The Bannister and Shamrock"

One scene should be going for a meal in the pub
There's a Red Herring dish on the menu, and if you order that then it comes on a plate showing an olden photograph of the pub but it's called "The Rose and Crown"

20:37:28 <evilnick|ipad> some hmhb lyrics are "Opposite the Bannister and Shamrock (which used to be the Rose and Crown) / I like to play Pat Boone on the county 
                         bassoon as the evening sun goes down"
20:38:00 <evilnick|ipad> which no-one will know, but is the kind of sly reference that I like in my games!
