The name of the pub should be "The Bannister and Shamrock"

One scene should be going for a meal in the pub
There's a Red Herring dish on the menu, and if you order that then it comes on a plate showing an olden photograph of the pub but it's called "The Rose and Crown"

20:37:28 <evilnick|ipad> some hmhb lyrics are "Opposite the Bannister and Shamrock (which used to be the Rose and Crown) / I like to play Pat Boone on the county 
                         bassoon as the evening sun goes down"
20:38:00 <evilnick|ipad> which no-one will know, but is the kind of sly reference that I like in my games!



16:41:57  * gevaerts just picked up the flag and the hole
16:42:17  * evilnick_B considers those to be bugs!
16:42:33  * gevaerts isn't sure
16:42:37 <evilnick_B> Also, the plate that delivers the red herring should only be visible AFTER the red herring meal is eaten
16:43:00 <gevaerts> I can do that. What you're seeing is basically the description of the herring
16:43:28 <gevaerts> If you take the hole though, it should be possible to put the hole in a door later on if you don't have the key
16:45:45 <evilnick_B> Oh, and definitely with taking the hole and using it to get through a gap/door later on
16:46:00 <evilnick_B> That's the kind of non-obvious and annoying solution that we absolutely need
16:46:20 <gevaerts> I wouldn't use that as the "official" solution, but it should work :)
16:46:38 <gevaerts> "put hole in wall"
16:47:03 <evilnick_B> Oooh, now that gives me an idea
16:47:21 <evilnick_B> A "hole in the wall" is slang for a cashpoint/ATM
17:11:16 <gevaerts> Oh, we could use the hole in another way too
17:11:29  * evilnick_B raises an eyebrow
17:11:35 <gevaerts> If you pick up the hole, you now have a hole in your pocker/holdall/bag :)
17:11:51 <gevaerts> i.e. you start losing other stuff randomly
17:11:56 <evilnick_B> loosing*
17:12:24  * gevaerts lost some grammar there. He only thought about picking up the hole, so it was in his head
17:12:26  * evilnick_B likes that idea too
17:12:42 <gevaerts> But you can still put it in walls or doors later on
17:12:53 <evilnick_B> But can we have a bottomless bag/sack which will hold it without stuff dropping through?
17:14:08 <gevaerts> Well, I see it as a trade-off. Either take the hole and get through doors without a key but drop things randomly (without it telling you of 
                    course!), or don't take the hole, you need keys or things, but you get to keep your stuff
17:14:44 <evilnick_B> Okay, that makes a lot of sense
17:15:22 <gevaerts> We need to think about how to prevent people just checking every turn
17:16:16 <evilnick_B> Checking what?
17:16:19 <evilnick_B> Their inventory?
17:16:28 <gevaerts> yes
17:16:42 <evilnick_B> We shouldn't stop them from checking
17:17:03 <evilnick_B> A random item falls out every n turns without causing the player to be alerted
17:17:13 <gevaerts> you mean, if they can be bothered to keep typing extra commands all the time, good for them?
17:17:27 <evilnick_B> But if they "look" then they'll see that item in their present location/not in their inventory
17:17:54 <gevaerts> Unless you lose things when moving to the next room, and it stays in the other one
17:18:22 <evilnick_B> Yep, that should happen within my rules above :)
17:18:46 <evilnick_B> Should the hole itself fall out of the bag?
17:19:40 <gevaerts> That would cause existential problems
17:19:47 <gevaerts> possibly :)
17:20:17 <evilnick_B> It could be argued that the hole is stuck to the outside of the bag, and so could drop off the bag, leaving it intact
17:20:33 <evilnick_B> Of course, real-world logic doesn't need to apply in this game
17:20:42 <evilnick_B> Only if we want it to, and only locally
17:21:14 <gevaerts> If real logic would apply, you couldn't take a hole out of a flag, keep it in your pocket for a while, and then put it in a wall
17:21:52 <gevaerts> I want that feature in soon though, so we can wait for play testers to complain that you can take the hole
17:22:18 <gevaerts> the basic feature anyway
17:22:25  * evilnick_B doesn't want many testers from -community involved
17:22:31 <gevaerts> indeed not
17:22:43 <evilnick_B> I want them to have the chance to play it "unsullied" when it's omplete
17:22:45 <evilnick_B> +c
17:22:46 <gevaerts> Torne sounds like a good tester, but the others? I don't think so
17:29:46 <evilnick_B> Torne would be (in my humble opinion) a great tester because he'd be able to break things
17:29:56  * evilnick_B endorses this choice
17:31:19  * gevaerts considers not doing anything about taking the flag as well. It might come in useful later
17:31:52 <gevaerts> Also, if the hole stays in the flag (instead of being in your pocket on its own), you obviously don't drop things
17:34:25 <gevaerts> Oh, there's a nice go-back-to-the-starting-point thing! If the hole ends up on the floor (i.e. you drop it), you fall through it
17:35:11 <gevaerts> You can't get the hole back then of course (which you probably can from the other side of a door/wall), unless you find another hole somewhere else
17:35:31  * gevaerts likes this hole business


21:58:27 <evilnick_B> If you know her name: She accepts one drink from you
21:58:40 <evilnick_B> If you don't know her name: she gets haughty and wanders off
